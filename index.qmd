# Welcome

A Virtual Research Environment (VRE) is a temporary compute environment that enables researchers to work interactively and remotely on research. A VRE contains tools and data that scientists need for their research. 

Utrecht University provides VREs based on SURF Research Cloud, which is a good alternative for commercial cloud providers like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.
