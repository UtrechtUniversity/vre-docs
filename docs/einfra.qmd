The eINFRA call is a non-competitive grant that can be used to request 50.000 credits and/or 10.000 GPU hours for Research cloud per calendar year per project .

More info about requirements and the application portal can be found [here](https://www.surf.nl/en/access-to-compute-services)

An example eINFRA application for Snellius can be found [here](https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=30660193). It illustrates the length and the level of detail of the specification of the project requirements.

If you have an existing collaboration and wallet for Research Cloud, please make sure to **mention the CO name and the name of the wallet in your eINFRA application** (check the 'Wallet' subpage on the research cloud portal for the name of the wallet). In this way you can keep using existing storage volumes and workspaces with the new budget.
