Title: "Defining Secrets in SRAM"
---

In the Research Cloud Dashboard go to the "Profile" tab. You will see a list of the Collaborative Organisations that you are a member of. Now:

1. Choose a CO, expand the display, and select the "Secrets" tab.
2. Click on the "+" icon to add a secret.
3. In the name field, type the name that will refer to the secret.
4. In the value field type or paste the secret value itself.

The value will show only now and never again.

From now on, any component parameter with the source-type "Co-Secret" can refer to this secret value if the workspace is started for this CO.
