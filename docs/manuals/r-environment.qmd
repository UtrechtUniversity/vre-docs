title: "R Environments"

# Overview

This manual describes the best practices for working with R environments in your SURF Research Cloud via [RStudio workspaces](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/vre-docs/docs/workspaces/programming/rstudio.html).
Using a project-specific R environment ensures that your work is:

- reproducible
- portable across workspaces
- independent of system-wide package changes

# Why use R environments?

R projects often depend on specific package versions. Without environment management, projects may:

- break after R or package updates
- behave differently across machines or workspaces
- be difficult to reproduce or share

If you would like to learn more about reproducible research workflows, the following workshops by Utrecht University may be useful:

- [Writing Reproducible Manuscripts in R](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management/workshops/writing-reproducible-manuscripts-in-r-and-python)

# R Environment Manager on SURF Research Cloud
## Recommended environment manager: `renv`

[`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) is the recommended tool for reproducible R environments in projects.

When using `renv` in a project:

- it creates a lock file with a list of packages and version numbers of those packages that are used.
- this makes it possible to install exactly those packages on a new computer 

[This example](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/hpc-school-vre-intro/blob/main/r-environment.md) contains a reproducible example project for demonstrating how to work with the R package `renv` on SURF Research Cloud.

To follow the example, make sure you have created an [RStudio](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/vre-docs/docs/workspaces/programming/rstudio.html) workspace. Information on how to create a workspace can be found [here.](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/vre-docs/docs/first-steps.html#create-a-workspace)
