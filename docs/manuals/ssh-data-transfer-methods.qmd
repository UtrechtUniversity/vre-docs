title: "Transferring data from your PC to your workspace using SCP and RSYNC"
---

The instructions on this page assume you have already setup SSH for Research cloud. If this is not the case, check the [Research Cloud documentation site](https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/Log+in+to+your+workspace#Logintoyourworkspace-AccessaworkspacewithSSH).

## scp
When you work on a Windows machine and you use MobaXterm for SSH connection, you can use the file browser in MobaXterm to intuitively transfer data. 

In all other cases: Open a terminal (or shell session) that you use for login in to your workspace via the `ssh` command. 

```
scp sourcefile <username>@<ip-address>:destinationdir
```

You can find both the username and the ip-address in the [research cloud portal](https://surfresearchcloud.nl).
Find your username under the 'Profile' tab.  
Find the IP address of your workspace in the main Dashboard by clicking the drop down arrow of the running Workspace.

```
scp testfile.txt <username>@<ip-address>:data/volume_2/input_data
```
If you first need to create a destination folder where you want to transfer the data to:

```
ssh <username>@<ip-address>
mkdir ~/data/volume_2/input_data
logout
scp testfile.txt <username>@<ip-address>:data/volume_2/input_data
```

To transfer a directory add the `-r` option:

```
scp -r sourcedir <username>@<ip-address>:data/volume_2/input_data
```

## rsync

Rsync is a tool for synchronizing two folders. This method can also be used to transfer the contents of a folder to a remote folder. You typically run this tool on your own PC in the [terminal](../manuals/terminal.qmd) (so e.g.before login in using the `ssh` command, or in a separate terminal (or shell session)).

Type `rsync --help` on to see if it is installed on your system. To install:

### Install

On Debian based linux (e.g. Ubuntu):

```
sudo apt-get install rsync
```

On mac:
```
brew install rsync
```

### Usage

```
rsync -azP ./my_local_folder <username>@<ip-address>:~/data/volume_2/input_data
```

Where `-azP` are options. Type `rsync --help` to see a list of the options.
