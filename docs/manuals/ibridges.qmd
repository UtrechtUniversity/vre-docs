title: Using iBridges on SURF Research Cloud
---

The instructions below describe the process of data transfer between SURF Research Cloud and Yoda using iBridges. iBridges is a command-line tool for transfering data to and from Yoda (and other iRODS servers), focused on user-friendliness. It is developed and supported by the Utrecht University Research Engineering team. Like the [iCommands suite](icommands.qmd), it is suitable for transferring large amounts of data, but it is easier to use.

Note: a graphical desktop version of iBridges is currently under development, but not yet supported on ResearchCloud.

### Prerequisites

You will need some basic Linux (commandline) skills to be able to use iBridges.

iBridges is already installed on many SURF ResearchCloud workspace developed by Utrecht University. You can check if it is present by simply typing the following command on your terminal: `ibridges`. If iBridges is installed, this should show you the program's help menu.

If you need to install iBridges, you can execute: `pip install ibridges`.
