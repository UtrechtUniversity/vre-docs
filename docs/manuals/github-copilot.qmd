title: "Using GitHub Copilot with Local VSCode on SURF Research Cloud"
---

# Overview

This guide explains how to use GitHub Copilot via your local VSCode while working on SURF Research Cloud. [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) is an AI-powered code completion tool that helps you write code faster.

Since GitHub Copilot is not available in ['VSCodium'](https://vscodium.com/) (an open source alternative to VS Code in the [Python Workbench Desktop workspace](../workspaces/programming/python-workbench.qmd)), this guide shows you how to use VSCode on your local computer to connect to your workspace via SSH and use Copilot remotely.


# Prerequisites

To follow this guide, you need:

1. Access to a running [Python Workbench Desktop workspace](../workspaces/programming/python-workbench.qmd) with VSCodium. You can find VSCodium under 'Applications' (topleft corner) in your workspace.

2.  Access to [GitHub Copilot.](https://github.com/features/copilot)

3. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed on your local computer.

#  One-Time Setup

## Step 1: Configure SSH Access

Follow the [SSH setup instructions](../first-steps.qmd#ssh) to:

1.  Create an SSH key pair on your local computer via the Terminal (MacOS and Linux) or preferred Windows shell (recommended: [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/)).

2.  Add your public key (`.pub` file) to your SRAM profile.


## Step 2: Get Workspace Connection Details

1. Go to the [SURF Research Cloud dashboard.](https://portal.live.surfresearchcloud.nl/)

2. Find your Python Workbench Desktop workspace and expand the tile to view additional details (**Make sure your workspace is running.**)

3. Note the **IP address** (e.g., `145.38.x.x`)

4. Note your SRAM **username**. This can be found in the **Profile** tab of the portal or by running the command `whoami` in the VSCodium terminal of your workspace.


## Step 3: Test SSH Connection

Before configuring your ssh settings, verify that your ssh key is working. On your local computer, open a terminal and run:
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 YOUR_USERNAME@YOUR_PUBLIC_IP
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your SRAM username and `YOUR_PUBLIC_IP` with the IP address of your workspace. 
If you have an `id_rsa` key instead of `id_ed25519`, adjust the path accordingly.

If you are connecting for the first time, you will see: `Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?`. Type `yes` and press Enter to continue. 
You may also be prompted to enter the passphrase for your SSH key if you set one up. You can press `enter` if you did not set up a passphrase.


If the connection is successful, you should see a welcome message from the server. You can exit the session by typing `exit`.


## Step 4: Configure SSH for Easier Access

Create an SSH configuration file to make connecting easier.

On your local computer, open a terminal and run:
```bash
nano ~/.ssh/config
```

Add the following configuration (**replace with your details**):
```
Host myworkspace
  HostName YOUR_WORKSPACE_IP_ADDRESS
  User YOUR_SRAM_USERNAME
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

You can replace `myworkspace` with any name you like. This will allow you to connect using `ssh myworkspace` instead of typing the full command each time.

Save the Configuration file:

- Press `Ctrl+O` (save)
- Press `Enter` (confirm filename)
- Press `Ctrl+X` (exit nano)

## Step 5: Test SSH Configuration

Test the connection from your terminal:
```bash
ssh myworkspace
```

This allows you to connect to your workspace without needing to type your IP address or key each time. Type `exit` to disconnect.

## Step 6: Install VS Code Extensions

1. Open **VS Code** on your local computer. You can install extensions either by clicking the Extensions icon (left sidebar) or pressing `Cmd+Shift+X` (Mac) / `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Windows).

2. Install the `Remote-SSH` extension by Microsoft.

3. Install the `GitHub Copilot` extension. Sign into GitHub when prompted and authorize Copilot.


# Using GitHub Copilot in Your Workspace

## Step 7: Connecting to Your Workspace

1. Open VS Code on your local computer

2. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) / `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows) to open the Command Palette 

3. Type `Remote-SSH: Connect to Host` and select it

4. Choose `myworkspace` from the list (or whatever name you used in your SSH config file)

5. A new VS Code window will open and connect to your workspace

6. Wait 30-60 seconds for the connection to establish (first time may take longer)

7. When connected, you'll see `SSH: myworkspace` in the bottom left corner


## Step 8: Verifying the Connection

1. Open a terminal in your VS Code window (the one connected to your workspace)

2. Run `whoami` - it should show your workspace username, not your local username

3. You're now working on the workspace filesystem through your local VS Code


## Step 9: Writing Code with Copilot

1. Open or create a folder: **File** → **Open Folder**

2. Create a new file with your programming language extension (e.g., `.py`)

3. Start typing code. Copilot will show gray suggestion texts as you type.
    - Press **Tab** to accept suggestions
    - Press **Esc** to dismiss suggestions

4. For further information on using GitHub Copilot in VSCode, click [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview)

5. Your files are saved to your SRAM workspace, and you can see them in the VSCodium file explorer to run them on the workspace as well.


### Selecting Python Environments

1. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P` in VS Code to open the Command Palette

2. Type `Python: Select Interpreter`

3. Choose from the available Python environments on your workspace


# Reconnecting:

Once configured, simply open VS Code and select `Remote-SSH: Connect to Host` → `myworkspace` each time you want to work on your workspace with GitHub Copilot. 


## Troubleshooting

**"Permission denied (publickey)" Error**

- Your SSH key may not be propagated to the workspace yet. Wait 5-10 minutes after adding it to SRAM.
- Verify your public key in SRAM matches your local key: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
- Try specifying the key explicitly: `ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 username@ip`

**"Network is unreachable" Error**

- You may be using the VSCodium's internal IP address instead of the workspace's IP address.
- Check the workspace details in the SRC dashboard for the correct public IP address.
- The public IP typically starts with `145.38.x.x`

**Connection Works in Terminal but Not in VS Code**

- Verify your SSH config file syntax: `cat ~/.ssh/config`
- Make sure the `Host`, `HostName`, `User`, and `IdentityFile` lines are correct
- Try connecting via terminal first: `ssh myworkspace`

**Copilot Not Showing Suggestions**

- Check that you're signed in to GitHub Copilot: Look for the Copilot icon in the bottom status bar
- Verify your Copilot subscription is active
- Try reloading the VS Code window: `Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Developer: Reload Window"

**Workspace IP Address Changed**

Workspace IP addresses may change when a workspace is restarted. If you can't connect:

1. Check the current IP in the SRC portal
2. Update your SSH config file with the new IP
3. Or connect directly: `ssh username@new-ip-address`


## Tips

- **Working directory**: When you connect, you start in your home directory. Use "Open Folder" to navigate to your project
- **Security**: **Never share your private SSH key. Only the public key (`.pub` file) should be uploaded to SRAM.**
