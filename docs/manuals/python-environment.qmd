title: "Python Environments"

# Overview
This manual describes the best practices for working with [Python environments](../workspaces/programming/python-workbench.qmd#python-environments) in your SURF Research Cloud workspace.
Using a dedicated Python environment ensures that your work is:

-  reproducible
-  portable across workspaces
-  independent of system-wide Python installation

# Why Use Python Environments?
Python environment managers allow you to install exactly the same packages and versions that were used to develop a project, even on a new system such as a SURF Research Cloud workspace with minimal effort.

Without environment management, projects may:

- break after system updates
- behave differently across machines
- be difficult to reproduce or share

If you would like to learn more about reproducible research workflows, the following workshop by Research Data Management at Utrecht University may be useful:

- Or read the [chapter on dependency management](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/workshop-computational-reproducibility/chapters/dependency-management.html)


# Python Environment Managers on SURF Research Cloud
 
[This repository](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/src-python-example) contains an example project for demonstrating how to work with different Python environment managing tools on SURF Research Cloud.

The repository provides information on working with the following workspaces:

 - [Python Workbench Desktop](../workspaces/programming/python-workbench.qmd)
 - [Jupyter Notebook](../workspaces/programming/jupyter.qmd)

The environment managers used are:

- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended)
- [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
- [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)

Information on how to create a workspace can be found [here.](../first-steps.qmd#create-a-workspace)

# Getting Started

## New to Python Environments?

### Step 1: Identify Your Dependencies

Check if your project has one of these dependency files:

-  `pyproject.toml`
-  `requirements.txt`
-  `environment.yml` 

If you do, move to **Step 2.**

If not, start by listing the packages you import in your code (e.g., `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`) and create a simple `requirements.txt` file with one package per line.

Alternatively, if you're already working in an environment and want to capture what's installed:
```bash
uv lock    # if you are working with uv
```
OR
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt  
```

Note: This captures *everything* in your current environment, so you may want to clean it up to include only what your project actually needs.

### Step 2: Set Up with `uv` (Recommended)

Navigate to your project folder and initialize:
```bash
cd /data/<your-storage-volume>/<your-project>
uv init 
uv venv --python 3.11  # create virtual environment with Python 3.11
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install your dependencies:
```bash
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml  # if you have a pyproject file
uv pip install -r requirements.txt  # if you have a requirements file
# OR
uv add pandas numpy matplotlib  # add packages individually
```

Start working:
```bash
python your_script.py
```

When you need to recreate the environment elsewhere, you can do so with lock files. This records the specific versions of all dependencies that were installed when the project was last configured:
```bash
uv lock      # Generate uv.lock
uv sync      # Recreate environment from lock file
```

Use `uv sync` when setting up the project on a new machine or workspace.

## Already Using Environment Managers?

`conda`, `poetry`, and `pyenv` are pre-installed, so you can continue using your existing workflow:

**conda:** Use your `environment.yml` file with `conda env create -f environment.yml` and activate with `conda activate your-env-name`.

**venv/virtualenv:** Create environments with `python -m venv .venv` and activate with `source .venv/bin/activate`. Install packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

**poetry:** Continue using `poetry install` to set up your environment and `poetry shell` to activate it.

**pyenv:** Use `pyenv` to manage and switch between different python versions. Combine it with `venv`, `conda`, or `poetry` for package management.
