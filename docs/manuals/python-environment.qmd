title: "Python Environments"

# Overview
This manual describes the best practices for working with [Python environments](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/vre-docs/docs/workspaces/programming/python-workbench.html#python-environments) in your SURF Research Cloud workspace.
Using a dedicated Python environment ensures that your work is:

-  reproducible
-  portable across workspaces
-  independent of system-wide Python installation

# Why Use Python Environments?
Python environment managers allow you to install exactly the same packages and versions that were used to develop a project, even on a new system such as a SURF Research Cloud workspace with minimal effort.

Without environment management, projects may:

- break after system updates
- behave differently across machines
- be difficult to reproduce or share

If you would like to learn more about reproducible research workflows, the following workshop by Research Data Management at Utrecht University may be useful:

- [Best Practices in Writing Reproducible Code](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management/training-workshops/best-practices-for-writing-reproducible-code)
- Or read the [chapter on depencency management](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/workshop-computational-reproducibility/chapters/dependency-management.html)


# Python Environment Managers on SURF Research Cloud
 
[This repository](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/src-python-example) contains an example project for demonstrating how to work with different Python environment managing tools on SURF Research Cloud.

The repository provides information on working with the following workspaces:

 - [Python Workbench Desktop](../workspaces/programming/python-workbench.qmd)
 - [Jupyter Notebook](../workspaces/programming/jupyter.qmd)

The environment managers used are:

- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended)
- [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
- [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)

Information on how to create a workspace can be found [here.](../first-steps.qmd#create-a-workspace)
