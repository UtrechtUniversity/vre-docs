title: "Python Environments"

# Overview
This manual describes the best practices for working with [Python environments](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/vre-docs/docs/workspaces/programming/python-workbench.html#python-environments) in your SURF Research Cloud workspace.
Using a dedicated Python environment ensures that your work is:

-  reproducible
-  portable across workspaces
-  independent of system-wide Python installation

# Why Use Python Environments?
Python environment managers allow you to install exactly the same packages and versions that were used to develop a project, even on a new system on a SURF Research Cloud workspace.

Without environment management, projects may:

- break after system updates
- behave differently across machines
- be difficult to reproduce or share

If you would like to learn more about reproducible research workflows, the following workshops by Utrecht University may be useful:

# Python Environment Managers on SURF Research Cloud
 [This repository](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/src-python-example) contains a reproducible example project for demonstrating how to work with different Python environment managing tools on SURF Research Cloud.

 The repository provides information on working with the following workspaces:

 - [Python Workbench Desktop](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/vre-docs/docs/workspaces/programming/python-workbench.html)
 - [Jupyter Notebook](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/vre-docs/docs/workspaces/programming/jupyter.html)


The environment managers used are:

- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended)
- [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
- [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)

Information on how to create a workspace can be found [here.](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/vre-docs/docs/first-steps.html#create-a-workspace)
