In order to know with what server iBridges should connect, a so-called iRODS environment file must be present in your home directory.

You may need help from your datamanager or contact Yoda support to obtain the information needed for the config file.

Go to your home directory and create a hidden directory called '.irods':

```
cd ~
mkdir .irods
cd .irods
```

In this directory, create a file named `irods_environment.json`.

```
touch irods_environment.json
```
Edit the file using a text editor such as nano or vim:
```
nano irods_environment.json
```

For information about Yoda servers hosted by Utrecht university go to the [yoda website](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/yoda/guide-to-yoda/i-am-using-yoda/using-icommands-for-large-datasets), scroll to **Step 2. Configuring iCommands** and copy and paste the text belonging to your institution in the file (similar to the file below) and change the email address next to `irods_user_name`to your yoda user name (typically your uu email address).

```
