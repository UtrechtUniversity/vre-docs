## Description

This catalog item starts a JupyterLab environment in which you can work with Jupyter notebooks.

Jupyter is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

All users in your Collaborative Organisation can login to the workspace and will then be presented with their own notebook environment.

If needed, we can help you to automatically install certain packages when the workspace is created, so that these are available from inside the Jupyter environment immediately. Please [contact us](../../contact.qmd) for this. However, you can of course also install your own dependencies from with the Notebook.

## Creation

{{< include ../partials/_storage.qmd >}}

{{< include ../partials/_creation.qmd >}}

## Access

You can login to the workspace in your browser, via [your ResearchCloud time-based password](../../first-steps.qmd#webapplications-that-require-a-time-based-password).

## Usage

When logged in you are immediately presented with a JupyterLab environment in which you can work with different notebooks.

### Using the Upload Button

For small files, use the Upload button in the JupyterLab file browser (left sidebar):

1. Click the **Upload Files** icon (↑) in the file browser toolbar
2. Select files from your local computer
3. Files will be uploaded to your current directory
:::

::: {.callout-note}
All command-line tools (iBridges CLI, iCommands, rclone, scp/rsync, Git) must be run from the [JupyterLab terminal](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/terminal.html).
:::

See our [data transfer manuals](../../manuals.qmd#data-transfer) for detailed step-by-step guides.


### Installing additional software

The user has [admin rights](../../responsible-use.qmd#installation-of-software) to install additional software on the system from the Jupyter terminal (use `sudo <command>`).
