## Description

This VRE Lab workspace hosts a [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) environment that provides [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) alongside a number of useful applications accessible through the browser. This catalog item can easily be extended with additional applications to suit your research needs.

Login is done via [SRAM](https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/spaces/IAM/pages/74226073/SURF+Research+Access+Management) via your institutional credentials.

The workspace includes Python environment management with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

You can automatically install environments and dependencies for Python, R, Julia, and Conda using the Custom Packages [Optional Component](#optional-components) provided in this workspace.

If you wish to customise this workspace further by installing system packages or need additional help, you can [contact us](../../contact.qmd)


## Creation

{{< include ../partials/_storage.qmd >}}

{{< include ../partials/_creation.qmd >}}

### Optional Components

VRE Lab allows you to customise your workspace by selecting additional optional components during workspace creation. This lets you pre-install tools for your research needs.

During workspace creation, you'll see an `Optional components` section where you can check the components you want to install.

![Select optional components](../imgs/vre-lab_components.png)


**Available components:**

- **[Open VSCode Server](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/getting-started)**: Web-based integrated development environment (IDE) for coding directly in your browser.
- **[OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/docs) UU**: Data cleaning and transformation tool accessible from JupyterLab.
- **Python tools**: Additional tools for managing Python environments (includes `uv`, `poetry`, and `conda`).
- **Custom Packages UU**: Automatically install dependencies for Python, R, Julia, or Conda projects from Git repositories, Zenodo, Dataverse, or DOI links.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Custom Packages UU
If you select "Custom Packages UU", you can provide a comma-separated list of project identifiers (e.g., GitHub URLs, Zenodo links, or DOIs) in the workspace parameters. These projects will be saved to `/local-share` with their dependencies installed in separate environments.
:::

Simply check the boxes for the components you need, then continue with workspace creation. You can always install additional software later using sudo rights from the terminal.


## Access

### Accessing the Workspace

1. Open your [SURF Research Cloud portal.](https://portal.live.surfresearchcloud.nl/)
2. When choosing your catalog item, simply search for **VRE Lab** and click the yellow **"Access"** button.
3. Log in with your institutional credentials (Solis ID for UU users).

Since you're already signed in to access SURF Research Cloud, you may not need to authenticate again.

### Requesting Access to the Catalog Item Collection

Most Utrecht University users already have access to this catalog item. If you cannot find VRE Lab when creating a workspace:

1. You need to request access to the **Utrecht University Catalog Item Collection.**
2. Follow these steps to [request access](../../manuals/catalog-item-access.qmd#requesting-access).
3. Once approved, you'll be able to create VRE Lab workspaces.


## Usage

After logging in, you'll have access to the [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) interface which includes: 

 - [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) for interactive coding
 - Additional browser-based applications
 - Integrated [terminal](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/terminal.html#terminals) access

You can also upload data directly to the workspace using the `Upload Files` button in the JupyterLab interface.

For larger data transfers, the recommended [iBridges client for Yoda and iRODS](../../manuals/ibridges.qmd) is preinstalled.

## Tips

This workspace includes `uv` for Python environment management. See the [Python environment manual](../../manuals/python-environment.qmd) for best practices and getting started.
