## Description

This VRE Lab workspace hosts a [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) environment that provides [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) alongside a number of useful applications accessible through the browser. This catalog item can easily be extended with additional applications to suit your research needs.

Login is done via [SRAM](https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/spaces/IAM/pages/74226073/SURF+Research+Access+Management) via your institutional credentials.

The workspace includes Python environment management with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

Upon request we can help you to automate the installation of packages or automate other installations (e.g. tools for data transfer). Automating these steps will make it easier to work following our [tips for responsible use](../../responsible-use.qmd).

## Creation

{{< include ../partials/_storage.qmd >}}

{{< include ../partials/_creation.qmd >}}

### Optional Components

VRE Lab allows you to customise your workspace by selecting additional optional components during workspace creation. This lets you pre-install tools for your research needs.

During workspace creation, you'll see an `Optional components` section where you can check the components you want to install.

![Select optional components](../imgs/vre-lab_components.png)


**Available components:**

- **Open VSCode Server**: Web-based integrated development environment (IDE) for coding directly in your browser.
- **OpenRefine UU**: Data cleaning and transformation tool accessible from JupyterLab.
- **Python tools**: Additional tools for managing Python environments (includes `uv`, `poetry`, and `conda`).
- **Custom Packages UU**: Automatically install dependencies for Python, R, Julia, or Conda projects from Git repositories, Zenodo, Dataverse, or DOI links.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Custom Packages UU
If you select "Custom Packages UU", you can provide a comma-separated list of project identifiers (e.g., GitHub URLs, Zenodo links, or DOIs) in the workspace parameters. These projects will be saved to `/local-share` with their dependencies installed in separate environments.
:::

Simply check the boxes for the components you need, then continue with workspace creation. You can always install additional software later using sudo rights from the terminal.


## Access

### Accessing the Workspace

1. Open your [SURF Research Cloud portal.](https://portal.live.surfresearchcloud.nl/)
2. When choosing your catalog item, simply search for **VRE Lab** and click the yellow **"Access"** button.
3. Log in with your institutional credentials (Solis ID for UU users).

Since you're already signed in to access SURF Research Cloud, you may not need to authenticate again.

### Requesting Access to the Catalog Item Collection

Most Utrecht University users already have access to this catalog item. If you cannot find VRE Lab when creating a workspace:

1. You need to request access to the **Utrecht University Catalog Item Collection.**
2. Follow these steps to [request access](../../manuals/catalog-item-access.qmd#requesting-access).
3. Once approved, you'll be able to create VRE Lab workspaces.


## Usage

{{< include ../partials/_data_transfer.qmd >}}

After logging in, you'll have access to the [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) interface which includes: 

 - [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) for interactive coding
 - Additional browser-based applications
 - Integrated [terminal](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/terminal.html#terminals) access

The recommended [iBridges client for Yoda and iRODS](../../manuals/ibridges.qmd) is preinstalled.

### Installing additional software

The user has [admin rights](../../responsible-use.qmd#installation-of-software) to install additional software on the system (on a terminal, use `sudo <yourcommand>`).

## Tips

This workspace includes `uv` for Python environment management. See the [Python environment manual](../../manuals/python-environment.qmd) for best practices and getting started.
