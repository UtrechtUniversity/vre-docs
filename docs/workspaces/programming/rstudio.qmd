## Description
This workspace can be used to work with R and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). RStudio can be accessed conveniently from the browser.

The workspace also comes with a (linux) terminal (aka command line) to install additional tools when relevant.

There are various flavours of this catalog item:

- R-Studio *(comes with R v.3)*
- R-Studio - R4 *(comes with R v.4)*

Upon request we can help you to automate the installation of R packages or automate other installations (e.g. tools for data transfer). Automating these steps will make it easier to work following our [best practices](../../responsible-use.qmd).
