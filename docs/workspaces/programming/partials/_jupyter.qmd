## Description
This workspace can be used to work with Jupyter Notebooks and Python. The workspace also comes with a (linux) terminal (aka command line) to install Python packages or other additional tools when relevant.

Upon request we can help you to install additional Python packages and preconfigure a Python environment or automate other installations (e.g. tools for data transfer). Automating these steps will make it easier to work following our [best practices](../../responsible-use.qmd).

[Contact us if you need help with installations](../../contact.qmd).

## Access
This workspace can be accessed via the yellow 'Access' button. You need a TOTP to login to your workspace, see [Workspace access with TOTP](https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/Log+in+to+your+workspace#Logintoyourworkspace-WorkspaceAccesswithTOTP).

## Data transfer options
First create a working directory on the [Storage Volume](../../first-steps.qmd#where-can-i-find-the-storage-volume) using the file browser in the Jupyter dashboard.

The Jupyter dashboard has an Upload button to directly upload data from your PC to the workspace. 

To download a file to your PC, right click the file in the file browser in the Jupyter dashboard, and several options will show including 'Download'.

Alternatively it is possible to use the terminal to transfer data from other, such as Yoda, or Surfdrive:

- [Data transfer and Yoda](../../manuals/icommands.qmd)
- [Data transfer and Surfdrive](../../manuals/rclone-researchcloud.qmd)

## Usage

### Start a Notebook

If you have uploaded an existing notebook, you can start it by clicking on the notebook file in the Jupyter dashboard.

To create a new notebook, click on the 'New' button in the Jupyter dashboard and select 'Python 3' under 'Notebook'.

### Installing Python packages

#### From within a Notebook
To install Python packages from within a Notebook, you can use the `!pip` command. For example, to install the Python package `pandas`:

```python
!pip install pandas
```

#### Using the terminal
To install Python packages, you can use the terminal. To start a terminal session, click on the 'New' button in the Jupyter dashboard and select 'Terminal' under 'Other'. 

For example, to install the Python package `pandas`:

```bash
pip install pandas
```
