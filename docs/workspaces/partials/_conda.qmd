### `conda`

To start using `miniconda` environments, use the `conda` command. You will be able to create two different kinds of environments:

- shared environments, available for all users. These can exist in two locations:
  - `/opt/miniconda/envs`
  - `/usr/local/uu/env/conda`
- personal environments, stored in your home directory and accessible only to you (and workspace admin users, if any).

To see all available environments, including shared environments, run `conda env list`.

To create a **shared** environment, run `conda create -p /opt/miniconda/envs/myenvname` (add other arguments to the command as you want).

To create a **personal** conda environment in your home directory, run `conda create -n myenvname`.

See the [miniconda docs](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/) for futher explanation of usage.
