# Transferring Single Files via the Desktop Interface
You can also transfer files directly from your PC to the workspace and vice-versa. **However, this works only for small and individual files**. 

- Open your windows workspace.
- In the top left, click on the three dots. Then select `Files` from the options that appear.
- Here you can choose individual files to upload from your local PC to the workspace, or download files from the workspace to your local PC.
