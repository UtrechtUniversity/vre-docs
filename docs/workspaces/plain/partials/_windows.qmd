## Description

ResearchCloud allows you to start Windows workspaces that use the Windows Server 2019 Operating System. There are various flavours:

- Windows Server 2019 (maintained by SURF)
- Windows Server 2019 with CUDA (with GPU support, maintained by SURF)
- Windows with iBridges (comes with [iBridges for data transfer](../../manuals/ibridges.qmd), maintained by UU)

Simply choose one of these [catalog items](../../glossary.qmd#catalog-item) in the workspace creation wizard.

## Access

You can [access Windows workspaces as a remote desktop in your browser](../../first-steps.qmd#browser-access-to-a-desktop-environment), authenticating via SRAM.

## Creation

{{< include ../partials/_creation.qmd >}}

## Usage

{{< include ../partials/_data_transfer.qmd >}}

When using the *Windows with iBridges* flavour, the recommended [iBridges client for Yoda and iRODS](../../manuals/ibridges.qmd) is preinstalled.
