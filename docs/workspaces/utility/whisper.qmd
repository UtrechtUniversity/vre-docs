## Description
This workspace can be used to work with the Whisper and WhisperX toolkits for transcribing, translation and diarization of human speech. On this workspace a Python environment is created using the environment manager 'conda'. The 'conda' environment contains [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper), [WhisperX](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX) and other required packages. The environment is configured to be able to use a GPU when available.

The workspace is a JupyterHub workspace, and comes with a template notebook to transcribe, translate and diarize audio files. The workspace is mainly aimed for users that have at least some very basic Python experience using Jupyter notebooks. However the workspace also provides a terminal (command line application) to run Whisper using the command line.

## Creation

{{< include ../partials/_storage.qmd >}}

{{< include ../partials/_creation.qmd >}}

## Access
This workspace can be accessed via the yellow 'Access' button. 

## Data transfer options
First create a working directory on the [Storage Volume](../../first-steps.qmd#where-can-i-find-the-storage-volume)

The JupyterHub dashboard has an Upload button to directly upload data from your computer. 

## Usage
Navigate to your home directory and start the template Jupyter notebook `whisper_template.ipynb` using the Whisper kernel. If you double click to start the notebook, make sure in the top right you see `whisper (ipykernel)` instead of `Python 3 (ipykernel)`. If you see `Python 3 (ipykernel)`, just click on it to change it to the Whisper kernel.
