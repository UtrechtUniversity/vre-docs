    "text": "Create storage volume\n\nWhy a storage volume?\nIn most cases you need to create a storage volume before you create a workspace. A workspace has limited storage and is temporary; all data stored on the workspace itself are deleted when a workspace is deleted. You can see a storage volume as a USB stick that you can attach to a workspace. A storage volume is persistent, so when you remove a workspace, all data on the storage volume will remain there. Storage volumes have good performance and are suitable for I/O-intensive computing tasks.\n\n\nHow to create a storage volume?\nIn the Research Cloud portal:\n\nClick ‘Create new storage’\nThe Wizard will guide you through the steps, some tips:\nChoose Storage HPC\nChoose the Collaborative Organization of the project for which you want to create the storage volume\nChoose the wallet with which you ‘pay’ for the Storage Unit\nChoose the size. It is not possible to resize it later on, so don’t choose too small, but also don’t choose too large because it will cost more credits.\nGive your storage volume a descriptive name so you can recognize it later on (e.g. use the name of the project or experiment)\n\n\n\nWhere can I find the storage volume?\nWhen you created a workspace and chose to attach a storage volume, the storage volume can be found via the following directory path: /data/volume_2 Typically you want to create a project folder in volume_2 (e.g. /data/volume_2/my_project)."

    "section": "Getting access to your workspace",
    "text": "Getting access to your workspace\nThere are several ways to login to your workspace.\n\nBrowser access\n\nWhen?\nThis is the easiest method and it can be used for most workspaces that have a Graphical user interface (Rstudio, Jupyter Notebook, Ubuntu Desktop, Matlab). It can not be used for Windows server. You can check if this method works for your workspace: look up your created workspace under workspaces in the dashboard of the research cloud portal. Click on the workspace (anywhere but don’t click the access button) and check the URL in the overview that opens. If the URL has an https:// address it can be accessed via the browser.\n\n\nHow?\nTo be able to login via the Browser you need to setup a Time Based Password for your Research Cloud account.\nThe workspaces can be accessed via your web browser by clicking the yellow access button. The username that you need to type when you want to access the workspace can be found under the ‘Profile’ tab in the Research Cloud portal. The password to fill in is the Time based password (aka TOTP password) from the authenticator app on your mobile phone.\n\n\n\nRDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)\n\nWhen?\nThis method can be used for most Windows Server workspaces, and any other workspaces that have an URL starting with RDP:// when you click on the workspace in the research cloud portal.\n\n\nHow?\nTo be able to login via RDP you need to setup a Time Based Password for your Research Cloud account.\nYou need an Remote Desktop client to be able to connect via RDP. On a Windows and MacOS PC you can use an application called ‘Remote Desktop’, on Linux we recommend ‘Remmina’.\nThe username that you need to type when you want to access the workspace can be found under the ‘Profile’ tab in the Research Cloud portal. The password to fill in is the Time based password (aka TOTP password) from the authenticator app on your mobile phone.\n\n\n\nSSH (secure shell protocol).\n\nWhen?\nFor some workspaces this is the only option to login to your workspace. These are typically command line only workspaces (e.g. Ubuntu 20.04 command line).\nSince connection via SSH also works for most other workspace types, it could also be a useful option in some other scenarios, e.g. when you want to copy a file from your laptop to the workspace.\n\n\nHow?\nThe research cloud documentation provides instructions on how to set up SSH for research cloud.\nTo connect to the workspace from a Windows computer you need specific software to use a ‘shell’ (also known as ‘terminal’), examples include Git Bash, PuTTY and MobaXterm. If you need to install something new, we would recommend MobaXterm.\nOn MacOS and Linux machines you can use the standard ‘Terminal’."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The instructions below describe the process of data transfer between Surf Research Cloud and Yoda using iCommands. This manual is developed for workspaces based on a Linux operating system (including the Jupyter Notebook and RStudio workspaces). Transfer is also possible via the Webdav protocol using Rclone. For large files iCommands is faster due to parallel transfer options.\n\nPrerequisites\nYou will need some basic linux skills to be able to use the iCommands successfully. If you don’t have these skills, take some time to practice using sections 1, 2, 3 and 7 of this short online course before proceeding. You can practice in the terminal (see step 1).\n\n\nStep 1: Make sure you are in a terminal\n\nIn Jupyterhub (Jupyter Workspace in Research cloud): To open a new terminal, click the + button in the file browser and select the terminal in the new Launcher tab (find a short video here).\nIn Rstudio (Rstudio workspace in Research cloud): In the bottom left panel, click the ‘terminal’ tab.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Install iRODS iCommands\nSome workspaces have iRODS iCommands preconfigured. This should be visible in step 1 when creating a workspace.\nCopy and paste (or type) the following commands in the terminal, or view the most up to date installation instructions for iRODS iCommands on the yoda website in the section “Installing iCommands on Ubuntu”.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y --only-upgrade ca-certificates\nwget -qO - https://packages.irods.org/irods-signing-key.asc | sudo apt-key add -\necho \"deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.irods.org/apt/ xenial main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/renci-irods.list\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt -y install aptitude irods-runtime=4.2.7 irods-icommands=4.2.7\nsudo aptitude hold irods-runtime irods-icommands\necho \"120\"  | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_time\necho \"30\" | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_intvl\necho \"net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time=120\" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf\necho \"net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_intvl=30\" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf\n\n\nStep 3: Create a config file\nYou may need help from your datamanager or contact Yoda support to obtain the information needed for the config file.\nGo to the home directory and create a hidden directory called ‘.irods’\ncd ~\nmkdir .irods\ncd .irods\nIn this directory, create a file named irods_environment.json.\ntouch irods_environment.json\nEdit the file using a text editor such as nano or vim\nnano irods_environment.json\nGo to the yoda website, scroll to Step 2. Configuring iCommands and copy and paste the text belonging to your institution in the file (similar to the file below) and change the email address next to irods_user_nameto your yoda user name (typically your uu email address).\n{   \n\"irods_host\": \"science.data.uu.nl\",   \n\"irods_port\": 1247,    \"irods_home\": \"/nluu6p/home\",   \n\"irods_user_name\": \"exampleuser@uu.nl\",   \n\"irods_zone_name\": \"nluu6p\",   \n\"irods_authentication_scheme\": \"pam\",   \n\"irods_encryption_algorithm\": \"AES-256-CBC\",   \n\"irods_encryption_key_size\": 32,   \n\"irods_encryption_num_hash_rounds\": 16,   \n\"irods_encryption_salt_size\": 8,   \n\"irods_client_server_negotiation\": \"request_server_negotiation\"\n}\n\n\nStep 4: Initialize connection to iRODS\nInitialize the connection to the Yoda system as follows:\niinit\nType your Yoda password when requested.\nType ils to see whether the connection has been established. The output of the ils command will list the current Yoda folder and the folders that are located within the current folder.\niinit and ils are commands which can only be used when icommands is active. Some of these commands are very similar to standard unix commands. When icommands is active you can still operate the HPC system using normal unix commands. A complete list of all ‘icommands’ can be found here.\n\n\nStep 5: Transferring data\nStandard transfer of a single file can be done using iget and iput\nThe irsync command can be used to synchronize entire directories between Yoda and Cartesius. The command is used as follows.\nirsync &lt;source&gt; &lt;destination&gt;\nIn contrary to the iput and iget commands, in irsync it is necessary to put ‘i:’ before the Yoda path. The Yoda path (directly after ‘i:’) to the folder that should be synchronized should be relative to the current Yoda folder (check with ils).\nE.g.\nirsync -rKV i:myfolder /my_researchcloud_folder\n-rKV means the following flags (options) are used:\n\n-r recursive - store the whole folder including subdirectories\n-K Calculate and verify the checksum on the data\n-V Very verbose\n\nTypically you will want to store data on the (persistent) storage volume that is attached to your workspace. Transfer it directly there as follows:\nirsync -rKV i:myfolder ~/data/volume_2/my_destination_folder\nTo synchronize in the opposite direction\nirsync -rKV /my_researchcloud_folder/ i:myfolder\n\nnote the ‘/’ at the end of /my_researchcloud_folder/ that is not used in the command above.\n\n\n\nParallel transfer\nWith icommands it is possible to transfer individual files in parallel using multiple threads, which results in higher transfer speeds. The flag -N can be used to control the number of parallel threads (only recommended in very specific situations). When not specified the server decides a default number of threads. For large files this number can be e.g. 16 threads.\nirsync -rKV -N 0 i:myfolder /my_researchcloud_folder"

More information.\n\n\nStorage volumes\nAn ‘External’ Storage volume can be created from the main dashboard in the research cloud portal. This storage is persistent which means that any data that you put here will still be there when a workspace is deleted. You need to create a storage volume first and attach it when you create a new workspace. The storage volume can than typically be found in the workspace under the following directory path: ~/data/volume_2. More info\n\n\nVRE\nVirtual Research Environment is the CO including the entire linked research services, linked other systems, applied software and used data.\n\n\nVRE support\nThe support at UU level for this service is done by Research Data Management Services. The team consists of service administrators for arranging access and accounts and research engineers who can advice on usage and can help develop proof of concepts.\n\n\nWallet\nA wallet holds the budget for your use of the Research Cloud. See the getting started page for the options to obtain a wallet for Research cloud. When you create a workspace you need to select a wallet that can be charged for the use of the resources.\n\n\nWorkspace\nA workspace is a running Virtual Machine (or aka server) that you can use as a Virtual Research Environment. You can create a workspace in the Research Cloud portal. The workspace will be created somewhere in ‘the cloud’, and when it is up and running you can login to it, transfer data to it and start working.

This is to minimize the use of resources (credits, energy, capacity). Although pausing a workspace is often an attractive option, it is only recommended for a period of a couple of days maximum. By deleting workspaces and creating a new workspace, you make sure you always have a machine with the most recent (security) updates. This can be done efficiently by:\n\ndocumenting or automating installation steps\nregularly saving data and scripts to a Persistent storage volume, e.g. Yoda or, Research Drive\nmanaging code on GitHub The VRE support team is happy to help you with this."

Consider moving data to e.g. Yoda and cleaning up storage volumensvolumes when not using research cloud for a couple of weeks. The UU provides a small starting budget of 10K credits for pilots or small projects, when this budget has been depleted we may provide a one time raise of your wallet of 10K credits if you can complete the project with this raise.

Plan an intake with the Research Engineering team\nDuring a 30 minute online meeting we will discuss the requirements for you research project and discuss the following topics:\n\nThe appropriate solution. RDM Support will help you determine which solution will meet the requirements of your research.\nThe required configuration. RDM Support will discuss the software and configuration that your research needs and how we can help you make your own software or scripts available.\nOther requirements. RDM Support can consult on related needs, such as research data management, to facilitate a complete and integral solution for your research.\nFunding arrangements. The VRE costs are covered on a pay-per-use basis. If you do not have a budget available, RDM Support can help you apply for “SURFsara credits” to get you started for a limited time. We can also help you with applying for more credits via SURF and NWO.\n\nThe Research engineer who is doing the intake has experience with the systems and can quickly assess your needs when looking together at your software. The engineer will advice you about how to proceed. When Research cloud meets the technical requirements of your project, we will arrange administration that is necessary to get started directly during the intake.\nSchedule an intake meeting.\n\n\n2. Request a collaboration in SRAM\nThis is typically done during an intake meeting (step 1). It is also possible to request a new collaboration in SRAM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is SRAM?\n\n\n\n\n\nSRAM (SURF Research Access Management) is a service to manage access to research resources, intended for Dutch led research collaborations. More information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a collaboration?\n\n\n\n\n\nA Collaboration (also known as Collaborative Organisation, or CO) is an ad-hoc group of people who are allowed to work together by sharing resources. As a scientist you can easily make a CO. That way, you can invite other researchers to join your efforts in Research Cloud, and you can then self-organise yourselves to distribute tasks, including administering the CO. More information.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Request funding\nThere are several ways to request funding for credits:\nUU Budget This is typically granted during an intake meeting (see step 1 above).\nE-INFRA request Via an E-INFRA request 50.000 CPU hours and/or 10.000 GPU can be requested for your project for 1 calendar year. An E-INFRA request can be done one time per calendar year. An application can be done via the SURF servicedesk and the procedure is relatively simple and fast. More information.\nExample application\nProject budget It is possible to pay for credits via your own project budget. Discuss the possiblities during an intake meeting (see step 1 above)."

The complex infrastructure behind the scenes is presented to you as a workspace. Think of a workspace as a laptop-in-the-cloud that you access using your web browser or another application (for instance “Remote Desktop” or “ssh”). Your web browser displays the screen content of this workspace and allows you to interact with it using your keyboard and mouse.\nWorkspaces are preconfigured with one or more applications, ranging from RStudio, Jupyter Notebooks, Matlab, to plain Windows or Linux virtual machines where the user installs their own software. Workspaces are also scalable: computational power, GPU drivers and extra storage can be ordered with a single mouse click. You can select a workspace type that suites your needs from a catalog in the SRC web portal. Workspaces are preconfigured for the user by support staff and can be extended on request to suit a variety of research domains and analysis methods. Should analysis applications for your domain not yet be covered, the support staff is happy to assist and to make additions to the catalog.\nOrdering a workspace is easy. In the SRC portal, just click on a workspace type to order it. The datacenter service will set aside some compute power for you. The datacenter subsequently creates a workspace and prepares it for you with applications preinstalled. This whole process takes approximately 10 to 30 minutes, depending on the type of workspace.\nA workspace is offered on-demand and on a pay-as-you-go basis. It saves you much hassle: no need to buy and maintain computer hardware and your favorite applications come conveniently preinstalled for you. This resource leasing concept is a cost effective solution if you plan to use it part-time, or if you seek to avoid to invest in expensive computer hardware, software or related IT-skills. Once you are done with using your workspace, just dispose of it in the SRC web portal.\nExample workspaces\n\nRstudio\n\nJupyter\n\nMatlab\n\nPython with Machine learning libraries\n\nCustomized workspaces e.g. ASReview\n\nWindows Server (install your own software)\n\nUbuntu (install your own software)\n\nResources available for a single workspace\n\nup to 80 CPU cores\n\nup to 480 GB RAM\n\nup to 4 GPU drives (NVIDIA A10)\n\nup to 2 TB storage"

Workspaces are also scalable: computational power, GPU drivers and extra storage can be ordered with a single mouse click. You can select a workspace type that suites your needs from a catalog in the SRC web portal. Workspaces are preconfigured for the user by support staff and can be extended on request to suit a variety of research domains and analysis methods. Should analysis applications for your domain not yet be covered, the support staff is happy to assist and to make additions to the catalog.\nOrdering a workspace is easy. In the SRC portal, just click on a workspace type to order it. The datacenter service will set aside some compute power for you. The datacenter subsequently creates a workspace and prepares it for you with applications preinstalled. This whole process takes approximately 10 to 30 minutes, depending on the type of workspace.\nA workspace is offered on-demand and on a pay-as-you-go basis. It saves you much hassle: no need to buy and maintain computer hardware and your favorite applications come conveniently preinstalled for you. This resource leasing concept is a cost effective solution if you plan to use it part-time, or if you seek to avoid to invest in expensive computer hardware, software or related IT-skills. Once you are done with using your workspace, just dispose of it in the SRC web portal.\nExample workspaces\n\nRstudio\n\nJupyter\n\nMatlab\n\nPython with Machine learning libraries\n\nCustomized workspaces e.g. ASReview\n\nWindows Server (install your own software)\n\nUbuntu (install your own software)\n\nResources available for a single workspace\n\nup to 80 CPU cores\n\nup to 480 GB RAM\n\nup to 4 GPU drives (NVIDIA A10)\n\nup to 2 TB storage"

    "text": "Designed with consortia and other Collaborative use in mind\nSurf Research Cloud uses the concept of a ‘collaboration’ to facilitate working together in project teams. A collaboration may be viewed as a virtual organization, with members that can originate from different research institutes, or from the private sector. A collaboration can accommodate a virtual organization the size of a European research project consortium. In contrast, it might also consist of a single member, e.g. a researcher in need of compute power or a private workspace.\nManaging memberships of the collaboration is done via a self-service portal (called SRAM, short for SURF Research Access Management. E.g. a researcher can give (temporary) access to PhDs or students.\nIt is important to understand that SRC assumes all members of the collaboration to be contractually or otherwise bound to work together.\nHence the costs related to a workspace ordered by a single member of the collaboration are effectively charged to the collaboration. In addition, the workspace is automatically accessible to all members of the collaboration."
