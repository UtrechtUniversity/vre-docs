Plan an intake with the Research Engineering team\nDuring a 30 minute online meeting we will discuss the technical requirements of your project. The Research engineer who is doing the intake has experience with the systems and can quickly assess your needs when looking together at your software. The engineer will advice you about how to proceed. When Research cloud meets the technical requirements of your project, we will arrange administration that is necessary to get started during the intake. Schedule an intake meeting.\n\n\n2. Request a collaboration in SRAM\nThis is typically done during an intake meeting (step 1). It is also possible to request a new collaboration in SRAM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is SRAM?\n\n\n\n\n\nSRAM (SURF Research Access Management) is a service to manage access to research resources, intended for Dutch led research collaborations. More information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a collaboration?\n\n\n\n\n\nA Collaboration (also known as Collaborative Organisation, or CO) is an ad-hoc group of people who are allowed to work together by sharing resources. As a scientist you can easily make a CO. That way, you can invite other researchers to join your efforts in Research Cloud, and you can then self-organise yourselves to distribute tasks, including administering the CO. More information.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Request funding\nThere are several ways to request funding for credits:\nUU Budget This is typically granted during an intake meeting (see step 1 above).\nE-INFRA request Via an E-INFRA request 50.000 CPU hours or 10.000 GPU can be requested for your project for 1 calendar year. An E-INFRA request can be done one time per calendar year. An application can be done via the SURF servicedesk and the procedure is relatively simple and fast. More information.\nExample application\nProject budget It is possible to pay for credits via your own project budget. Discuss the possiblities during an intake meeting (see step 1 above)."

Students and employees from most Universities (and Universities of Applied Sciences) will be able to login to SRAM using their institution credentials. Collaborators from abroad or e.g. private sector can create an eduID first and then use that to login to SRAM and accept the invitation.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.

    "text": "Create storage volume\n\nWhy a storage volume?\nIn most cases you need to create a storage volume before you create a workspace. A workspace has limited storage and is temporary; all data stored on the workspace itself are deleted when a workspace is deleted. You can see a storage volume as a USB stick that you can attach to a workspace. A storage volume is persistent, so when you remove a workspace, all data on the storage volume will remain there. Storage volumes have good performance and are suitable for I/O-intensive computing tasks.\n\n\nHow to create a storage volume?\nIn the Research Cloud portal: * Click ‘Create new storage’ * The Wizard will guide you through the steps, some tips: * Choose Storage HPC * Choose the Collaborative Organization of the project for which you want to create the storage volume * Choose the wallet with which you ‘pay’ for the Storage Unit * Choose the size. It is not possible to resize it later on, so don’t choose too small, but also don’t choose too large because it will cost more credits. * Give your storage volume a descriptive name so you can recognize it later on (e.g. use the name of the project or experiment)"

Important: on this date the machine and all data on it will be deleted without warning. Only data on the Storage volume will remain. The expiration date can be changed later on. * Give the workspace a descriptive title that you can recognize later on. * Click Submit"

    "text": "Surf ResearchCloud (SRC) is a service that allows you to use the vast computational power offered by datacenters with almost the same ease-of-use as using your own laptop. The complex infrastructure behind the scenes is presented to you as a workspace. Think of a workspace as a laptop-in-the-cloud that you access using your web browser or another application (for instance “Remote Desktop” or “ssh”). Your web browser displays the screen content of this workspace and allows you to interact with it using your keyboard and mouse.\nWorkspaces are preconfigured with one or more applications, ranging from RStudio, Jupyter Notebooks, Matlab, to plain Windows or Linux virtual machines where the user installs their own software. Workspaces are also scalable: computational power, GPU drivers and extra storage can be ordered with a single mouse click. You can select a workspace type that suites your needs from a catalog in the SRC web portal. Workspaces are preconfigured for the user by support staff and can be extended on request to suit a variety of research domains and analysis methods. Should analysis applications for your domain not yet be covered, the support staff is happy to assist and to make additions to the catalog.\nOrdering a workspace is easy. In the SRC portal, just click on a workspace type to order it. The datacenter service will set aside some compute power for you. The datacenter subsequently creates a workspace and prepares it for you with applications preinstalled. This whole process takes approximately 10 to 30 minutes, depending on the type of workspace.\nA workspace is offered on-demand and on a pay-as-you-go basis. It saves you much hassle: no need to buy and maintain computer hardware and your favorite applications come conveniently preinstalled for you. This resource leasing concept is a cost effective solution if you plan to use it part-time, or if you seek to avoid to invest in expensive computer hardware, software or related IT-skills. Once you are done with using your workspace, just dispose of it in the SRC web portal.\nExample workspaces\n- Rstudio\n- Jupyter\n- Matlab\n- Python with Machine learning libraries\n- Customized workspaces e.g. ASReview\n- Windows Server (install your own software)\n- Ubuntu (install your own software)\nResources available for a single workspace\n- up to 80 CPU cores\n- up to 480 GB RAM\n- up to 4 GPU drives\n- up to 2 TB storage"

    "text": "Designed with consortia and other Collaborative use in mind\nSurf Research Cloud uses the concept of a ‘collaboration’ to facilitate working together in project teams. A collaboration may be viewed as a virtual organization, with members that can originate from different research institutes, or from the private sector. A collaboration can accommodate a virtual organization the size of a European research project consortium. In contrast, it might also consist of a single member, e.g. a researcher in need of compute power or a private workspace.\nManaging memberships of the collaboration is done via a self-service portal (called SRAM, short for SURF Research Access Management. E.g. a researcher can give (temporary) access to PhDs or students.\nIt is important to understand that SRC assumes all members of the collaboration to be contractually or otherwise bound to work together.\nHence the costs related to a workspace ordered by a single member of the collaboration are effectively charged to the collaboration. In addition, the workspace is automatically accessible to all members of the collaboration."
