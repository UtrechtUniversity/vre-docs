    "text": "Surf ResearchCloud (SRC) is a service that allows you to use the vast computational power offered by datacenters with almost the same ease-of-use as using your own laptop. The complex infrastructure behind the scenes is presented to you as a workspace. Think of a workspace as a laptop-in-the-cloud that you access using your web browser or another application (for instance “Remote Desktop” or “ssh”). Your web browser displays the screen content of this workspace and allows you to interact with it using your keyboard and mouse.\nWorkspaces are preconfigured with one or more applications, ranging from RStudio, Jupyter Notebooks, Matlab, to plain Windows or Linux virtual machines where the user installs their own software. Workspaces are also scalable: computational power, GPU drivers and extra storage can be ordered with a single mouse click. You can select a workspace type that suites your needs from a catalog in the SRC web portal. Workspaces are preconfigured for the user by support staff and can be extended on request to suit a variety of research domains and analysis methods. Should analysis applications for your domain not yet be covered, the support staff is happy to assist and to make additions to the catalog.\nOrdering a workspace is easy. In the SRC portal, just click on a workspace type to order it. The datacenter service will set aside some compute power for you. The datacenter subsequently creates a workspace and prepares it for you with applications preinstalled. This whole process takes approximately 10 to 30 minutes, depending on the type of workspace.\nA workspace is offered on-demand and on a pay-as-you-go basis. It saves you much hassle: no need to buy and maintain computer hardware and your favorite applications come conveniently preinstalled for you. This resource leasing concept is a cost effective solution if you plan to use it part-time, or if you seek to avoid to invest in expensive computer hardware, software or related IT-skills. Once you are done with using your workspace, just dispose of it in the SRC web portal.\nExample workspaces\n- Rstudio\n- Jupyter\n- Matlab\n- Python with Machine learning libraries\n- Customized workspaces e.g. ASReview\n- Windows Server (install your own software)\n- Ubuntu (install your own software)\nResources available for a single workspace\n- up to 80 CPU cores\n- up to 480 GB RAM\n- up to 4 GPU drives\n- up to 2 TB storage"

    "text": "Designed with consortia and other Collaborative use in mind\nSurf Research Cloud uses the concept of a ‘collaboration’ to facilitate working together in project teams. A collaboration may be viewed as a virtual organization, with members that can originate from different research institutes, or from the private sector. A collaboration can accommodate a virtual organization the size of a European research project consortium. In contrast, it might also consist of a single member, e.g. a researcher in need of compute power or a private workspace.\nManaging memberships of the collaboration is done via a self-service portal (called SRAM, short for SURF Research Access Management. E.g. a researcher can give (temporary) access to PhDs or students.\nIt is important to understand that SRC assumes all members of the collaboration to be contractually or otherwise bound to work together.\nHence the costs related to a workspace ordered by a single member of the collaboration are effectively charged to the collaboration. In addition, the workspace is automatically accessible to all members of the collaboration."

A workspace has limited storage and is temporary; all data stored on the workspace itself are deleted when a workspace is deleted. You can see a storage volume as a USB stick that you can attach to a workspace. A storage volume is persistent, so when you remove a workspace, all data on the storage volume will remain there. Storage volumes have good performance and are suitable for I/O-intensive computing tasks.\n\n\nHow to create a storage volume?\nIn the Research Cloud portal:\n\nClick ‘Create new storage’\nThe Wizard will guide you through the steps, some tips:\nChoose Storage HPC\nChoose the Collaborative Organization of the project for which you want to create the storage volume\nChoose the wallet with which you ‘pay’ for the Storage Unit\nChoose the size. It is not possible to resize it later on, so don’t choose too small, but also don’t choose too large because it will cost more credits.\nGive your storage volume a descriptive name so you can recognize it later on (e.g. use the name of the project or experiment)\n\n\n\nWhere can I find the storage volume?\nWhen you created a workspace and chose to attach a storage volume, the storage volume can be found via the following directory path: /data/volume_2 Typically you want to create a project folder in volume_2 (e.g. /data/volume_2/my_project)."

    "text": "Getting access to your workspace\nThere are several ways to login to your workspace.\n\nBrowser access\n\nWhen?\nThis is the easiest method and it can be used for most workspaces that have a Graphical user interface (Rstudio, Jupyter Notebook, Ubuntu Desktop, Matlab). It can not be used for Windows server. You can check if this method works for your workspace: look up your created workspace under workspaces in the dashboard of the research cloud portal. Click on the workspace (anywhere but don’t click the access button) and check the URL in the overview that opens. If the URL has an https:// address it can be accessed via the browser.\n\n\nHow?\nTo be able to login via the Browser you need to setup a Time Based Password for your Research Cloud account.\nThe workspaces can be accessed via your web browser by clicking the yellow access button. The username that you need to type when you want to access the workspace can be found under the ‘Profile’ tab in the Research Cloud portal. The password to fill in is the Time based password (aka TOTP password) from the authenticator app on your mobile phone.\n\n\n\nRDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)\n\nWhen?\nThis method can be used for most Windows Server workspaces, and any other workspaces that have an URL starting with RDP:// when you click on the workspace in the research cloud portal.\n\n\nHow?\nTo be able to login via RDP you need to setup a Time Based Password for your Research Cloud account.\nYou need an Remote Desktop client to be able to connect via RDP. On a Windows and MacOS PC you can use an application called ‘Remote Desktop’, on Linux we recommend ‘Remmina’.\nThe username that you need to type when you want to access the workspace can be found under the ‘Profile’ tab in the Research Cloud portal. The password to fill in is the Time based password (aka TOTP password) from the authenticator app on your mobile phone.\n\n\n\nSSH (secure shell protocol).\n\nWhen?\nFor some workspaces this is the only option to login to your workspace. These are typically command line only workspaces (e.g. Ubuntu 20.04 command line).\nSince connection via SSH also works for most other workspace types, it could also be a useful option in some other scenarios, e.g. when you want to copy a file from your laptop to the workspace.\n\n\nHow?\nThe research cloud documentation provides instructions on how to set up SSH for research cloud.\nTo connect to the workspace from a Windows computer you need specific software to use a ‘shell’ (also known as ‘terminal’), examples include Git Bash, PuTTY and MobaXterm. If you need to install something new, we would recommend MobaXterm.\nOn MacOS and Linux machines you can use the standard ‘Terminal’."

    "text": "Rclone has an interactive menu to generate a config file for you. You need to complete this menu once for each storage platform that you want to connect to. You can use Rclone for many different types of storage platforms: check the homepage for a list. SURFdrive and Research drive are based on ownCloud software. Platforms built on standard protocols such as WebDAV (including Yoda, Data Archive or the U: network drive of UU student and employees) are also supported but require slightly different configuration steps.\nTo check whether Rclone is available on your system:\nrclone version\nYou should see a version number displayed in the terminal.\nTo start the interactive menu:\nrclone config\nNow walk through the questions. For SURFdrive you need the following information (Rclone version 1.55.1)\n\nType n for New remote\nFor ‘name’ choose e.g. surfdrive (or SD)\nChoose option 40for WebDAV \nFill in the URL. You can look this up via the web portal of SURFdrive. In the top right corner click your account name. Go to settings. In the left panel, click security. At the very bottom of the page there will be a section WebDAV passwords. There is also an URL, something like: https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/remote.php/nonshib-webdav\nUse this URL.\nBefore you continue with the Rclone menu, first perform the following step via the web portal of SURFdrive. Fill in an app name (e.g. lisa) on the security settings page (same page as previous step) and click “create new app password”. The page will show a username and a password. You will need these in the following steps of the Rclone menu.\nSelect the type of WebDAV storage system. Type: 2 for ownCloud.\nType in your user name from SURFdrive (this is the username found in the web portal (step 5))\nSelect: y) Yes type in my own password\nType in your password from the web portal and type it in again for confirmation.\nSkip the Bearer token option by pressing enter.\nChoose n to skip the advanced config\nConfirm your settings by typing y.\nChoose q to quit the menu.\n\nTest whether everything is setup correctly by typing the following command in the terminal, if necessary change surfdrive: to any other name chosen in step 2.:\nrclone lsd surfdrive:\nIf everything is setup correctly, you should see a list of files and folders that are present on your SURFdrive.\n\nNext: Using rclone for data transfer"

Synchronization with Rclone makes the destination folder equal to the source folder and deletes files and folders in the destination folder that are not present in the source folder. Therefore it is wise to use the –dry-run flag to see what will be copied and deleted before actually running the command. rclone sync &lt;source&gt; &lt;destination&gt; --dry-run\n\nrclone sync surfdrive:my_source_folder ~/data/volume_2/destination_folder_with_any_name --dry-run\nrclone sync surfdrive:my_source_folder ~/data/volume_2/destination_folder_with_any_name -cPv\n-cPv means the following flags (options) are used:\n-c skip files that are already present (compared using checksums)\n-P report progress of transfer\n-v verbose; increase the amount of information in the logs\n\n\nTransfer in opposite direction\nCopying in the opposite direction is easy, use the same commands as described above and start with the research cloud folder and end with the surfdrive folder:\nrclone copy ~/data/volume_2/destination_folder_with_any_name/file.txt surfdrive:my_destination_folder \nrclone sync ~/data/volume_2/destination_folder_with_any_name surfdrive:my_destination_folder  -cPv\nFurther reading: - For all Rclone commands see: https://rclone.org/commands/"

    "section": "",
    "text": "The instructions below describe the process of data transfer between Surf Research Cloud and Yoda using iCommands. This manual is developed for workspaces based on a Linux operating system (including the Jupyter Notebook and RStudio workspaces). Transfer is also possible via the Webdav protocol using Rclone. For large files iCommands is faster due to parallel transfer options.\n\nPrerequisites\nYou will need some basic linux skills to be able to use the iCommands successfully. If you don’t have these skills, take some time to practice using sections 1, 2, 3 and 7 of this short online course before proceeding. You can practice in the terminal (see step 1).\n\n\nStep 1: Make sure you are in a terminal\n\nIn Jupyterhub (Jupyter Workspace in Research cloud): To open a new terminal, click the + button in the file browser and select the terminal in the new Launcher tab (find a short video here).\nIn Rstudio (Rstudio workspace in Research cloud): In the bottom left panel, click the ‘terminal’ tab.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Install iRODS iCommands\nSome workspaces have iRODS iCommands preconfigured. This should be visible in step 1 when creating a workspace.\nCopy and paste (or type) the following commands in the terminal, or view the most up to date installation instructions for iRODS iCommands on the yoda website in the section “Installing iCommands on Ubuntu”.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y --only-upgrade ca-certificates\nwget -qO - https://packages.irods.org/irods-signing-key.asc | sudo apt-key add -\necho \"deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.irods.org/apt/ xenial main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/renci-irods.list\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt -y install aptitude irods-runtime=4.2.7 irods-icommands=4.2.7\nsudo aptitude hold irods-runtime irods-icommands\necho \"120\"  | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_time\necho \"30\" | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_intvl\necho \"net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time=120\" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf\necho \"net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_intvl=30\" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf\n\n\nStep 3: Create a config file\nYou may need help from your datamanager or contact Yoda support to obtain the information needed for the config file.\nGo to the home directory and create a hidden directory called ‘.irods’\ncd ~\nmkdir .irods\ncd .irods\nIn this directory, create a file named irods_environment.json.\ntouch irods_environment.json\nEdit the file using a text editor such as nano or vim\nnano irods_environment.json\nGo to the yoda website, scroll to Step 2. Configuring iCommands and copy and paste the text belonging to your institution in the file (similar to the file below) and change the email address next to irods_user_nameto your yoda user name (typically your uu email address).\n{   \n\"irods_host\": \"science.data.uu.nl\",   \n\"irods_port\": 1247,    \"irods_home\": \"/nluu6p/home\",   \n\"irods_user_name\": \"exampleuser@uu.nl\",   \n\"irods_zone_name\": \"nluu6p\",   \n\"irods_authentication_scheme\": \"pam\",   \n\"irods_encryption_algorithm\": \"AES-256-CBC\",   \n\"irods_encryption_key_size\": 32,   \n\"irods_encryption_num_hash_rounds\": 16,   \n\"irods_encryption_salt_size\": 8,   \n\"irods_client_server_negotiation\": \"request_server_negotiation\"\n}\n\n\nStep 4: Initialize connection to iRODS\nInitialize the connection to the Yoda system as follows:\niinit\nType your Yoda password when requested.\nType ils to see whether the connection has been established. The output of the ils command will list the current Yoda folder and the folders that are located within the current folder.\niinit and ils are commands which can only be used when icommands is active. Some of these commands are very similar to standard unix commands. When icommands is active you can still operate the HPC system using normal unix commands. A complete list of all ‘icommands’ can be found here.\n\n\nStep 5: Transferring data\nStandard transfer of a single file can be done using iget and iput\nThe irsync command can be used to synchronize entire directories between Yoda and Cartesius. The command is used as follows.\nirsync &lt;source&gt; &lt;destination&gt;\nIn contrary to the iput and iget commands, in irsync it is necessary to put ‘i:’ before the Yoda path. The Yoda path (directly after ‘i:’) to the folder that should be synchronized should be relative to the current Yoda folder (check with ils).\nE.g.\nirsync -rKV i:myfolder /my_researchcloud_folder\n-rKV means the following flags (options) are used:\n\n-r recursive - store the whole folder including subdirectories\n-K Calculate and verify the checksum on the data\n-V Very verbose\n\nTypically you will want to store data on the (persistent) storage volume that is attached to your workspace. Transfer it directly there as follows:\nirsync -rKV i:myfolder ~/data/volume_2/my_destination_folder\nTo synchronize in the opposite direction\nirsync -rKV /my_researchcloud_folder/ i:myfolder\n\nnote the ‘/’ at the end of /my_researchcloud_folder/ that is not used in the command above.\n\n\n\nParallel transfer\nWith icommands it is possible to transfer individual files in parallel using multiple threads, which results in higher transfer speeds. The flag -N can be used to control the number of parallel threads (only recommended in very specific situations). When not specified the server decides a default number of threads. For large files this number can be e.g. 16 threads.\nirsync -rKV -N 0 i:myfolder /my_researchcloud_folder"

Plan an intake with the Research Engineering team\nDuring a 30 minute online meeting we will discuss the technical requirements of your project. The Research engineer who is doing the intake has experience with the systems and can quickly assess your needs when looking together at your software. The engineer will advice you about how to proceed. When Research cloud meets the technical requirements of your project, we will arrange administration that is necessary to get started during the intake. Schedule an intake meeting.\n\n\n2.

It is also possible to request a new collaboration in SRAM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is SRAM?\n\n\n\n\n\nSRAM (SURF Research Access Management) is a service to manage access to research resources, intended for Dutch led research collaborations. More information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a collaboration?\n\n\n\n\n\nA Collaboration (also known as Collaborative Organisation, or CO) is an ad-hoc group of people who are allowed to work together by sharing resources. As a scientist you can easily make a CO. That way, you can invite other researchers to join your efforts in Research Cloud, and you can then self-organise yourselves to distribute tasks, including administering the CO. More information.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Request funding\nThere are several ways to request funding for credits:\nUU Budget This is typically granted during an intake meeting (see step 1 above).\nE-INFRA request Via an E-INFRA request 50.000 CPU hours or 10.000 GPU can be requested for your project for 1 calendar year. An E-INFRA request can be done one time per calendar year. An application can be done via the SURF servicedesk and the procedure is relatively simple and fast. More information.\nExample application\nProject budget It is possible to pay for credits via your own project budget. Discuss the possiblities during an intake meeting (see step 1 above)."
